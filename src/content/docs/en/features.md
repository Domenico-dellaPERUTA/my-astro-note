# Notes Management

In this section you will learn how to manage your content.

## Actions Menu
Next to each note in the sidebar, you will find a **🛠️** (Actions Menu) icon. Click on this icon to access the available options:

- **➕ Add sub-note**: Create a new child note.
- **✂️ Cut**: To move the note.
- **📋 Paste here**: To paste a previously cut note as a child of this one.
- **🔗 Copy Link**: Copy the internal link to the note to create connections.
- **📝 Edit / Finish Editing**: Enable or disable edit mode for the note.
- **🗑️ Delete**: Delete the note and all its contents (including children!).

## Creating a root note
To create a new main note (without parents), use the **➕** button at the top of the sidebar, next to the "NOTES LIST" title.

## Moving a note (Cut and Paste)
1. Open the **🛠️** menu of the note you want to move and choose **Cut** ✂️.
2. Go to the destination note, open the **🛠️** menu and choose **Paste here** 📋.
3. Alternatively, to move it to the root, use the **📋** button at the top of the sidebar.

## Content Management
Once you have selected a note, you can edit its title and main content. Remember to save your changes with the "Save" button at the bottom.


## Media Management (Images and Files)
If you are an administrator, you can manage media files via the **📁 Files** button in the top bar.

1. **Upload**: You can upload images or documents to the `WebApp` folder.
2. **Inserting into Notes**: 
   - In the File Manager, click on the chain icon **🔗** next to a file to copy the Markdown code to your clipboard.
   - Paste this code into your note text to display the file (e.g.: `![image](/WebApp/photo.jpg)`).
3. **Organization**: Create folders, rename or delete files to keep everything organized.
