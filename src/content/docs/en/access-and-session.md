# Access and Session

The application manages two types of permissions to ensure the security of your data.


## Guest Mode
By default, every time you open the application, you will be in **guest mode**. In this mode you can:
- Read all existing notes.
- Consult this guide.
- Search through your notes.

In guest mode it is **not possible** to create, modify or delete notes or files.

## Becoming Administrator (Login)
To unlock editing functions:
1. Click on the user icon **👤** in the top bar.
2. You will be redirected to the login page.
3. Enter your credentials (Username, Password and OTP Token).
4. After logging in, you will be taken back to the home page. You will notice that the user button is now dark (or red) and extra buttons like **➕ New Note** and **📁 Files** have appeared.

## Returning to Guest (Logout)
If you want to protect the session or return to read-only mode:
1. Hover over the user icon **👤**. The message "Logout Administrator" will appear.
2. **Click the button**. 
3. The session will be closed immediately and the application will return to guest mode.
